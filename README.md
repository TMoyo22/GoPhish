## :star2: About the Project

GoPhish is a cybersecurity education tool that helps organizations train employees to recognize phishing attacks. The system automates the process of sending phishing emails at random intervals and tracks user interactions. If a user clicks a link, they are redirected to an AI chatbot that educates them about phishing tactics.
